### `[DEMO WILL BE HERE]`

The terminal is a realm of immense power, but also of entropy. Commands are forgotten, workflows fracture, and focus is lost to the noise. **Drako** is a **TUI-Deck launcher** that imposes structure, transforming your terminal into a disciplined, grid-based command center.


## üöÄ Quick Start: A Single Command

`drako` is forged in Go for speed and simplicity. If go is installed, installing `drako` is a single command.

```bash
go install github.com/lucky/drako/drako@latest  # install drako
```

Note that it will install `drako` to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory. If you don't have a `$GOPATH`, you can set it to your `$HOME/go` directory via:

```bash
# Golang environment variables
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

# Update PATH to include GOPATH and GOROOT binaries
export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH

```

### Install Go

- Windows: https://go.dev/dl/ // official Go installer
- macOS: `brew install go` // Homebrew
- Arch: `sudo pacman -S go` // pacman
- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): `sudo apt install golang` // apt


Run `drako`. On its first execution, it will construct your configuration file at `~/.config/drako/config.toml`. This is the foundation. Modify it to begin bending your workflow into shape.


## Navigation

- **Grid Navigation:** Use w/a/s/d/arrow keys or vim keys (h, j, k, l) to move around the grid. 
- **Switch Profile:** Use `Shift` + number keys (`1`-`9`) to switch directly to a profile. Use `Shift` + backtick (`) to cycle to the next profile.
- **Prifile Inventory:** Use `i` to open the profile inventory to add/remove profiles from your rotation.
- **Lock Current Profile:** Press `r` to lock or unlock the current profile.
- **Tab:** Press `tab` to switch from grid mode to directory mode, or vice versa.
- **Quit:** Press `q` to exit `drako`. Note that TUIs opened with drako will be closed via their own quit command.




## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Example

All power emanates from `~/.config/drako/config.toml`.

#### Base Configuration (`config.toml`)

```toml
# Grid dimensions
x = 4
y = 8

# --- Define your commands ---
[[commands]]
name = "File System"
command = "yazi"
col = 0
row = 1
interactive = true # For full-screen applications

[[commands]]
name = "Git Status"
command = "git status"
col = 1
row = 0
interactive = false # For commands that print and exit

[[commands]]
name = "Update & Upgrade"
command = "sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade"
col = 0
row = 0
interactive = true
hold_after = true # For commands that require user interaction, but should not automatically exit


```

#### Profile Overlay (`~/.config/drako/security.profile.toml`)

Create a new file with the `.profile.toml` extension. `drako` will discover it automatically.

```toml
# This profile redefines the grid for security tasks.
x = 3
y = 4

[[commands]]
name = "nmap LAN"
command = "nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24"
col = 0
row = 0
interactive = false

[[commands]]
name = "Bandwidth"
command = "bmon"
col = 0
row = 1
interactive = true
```

## ‚ú® The Core Philosophy

`drako` is built on a few core principles:

-   **The Grid is Your Command Deck.** Your most vital commands are laid out on a visual grid for immediate, single-keypress access. No more searching shell history or forgotten aliases.

-   **Profiles are Shifting Forms.** A profile is a complete reconfiguration of the grid for a different context. Switch from a "Go Developer" deck (`go build`, `go test`) to a "Network Sentinel" deck (`nmap`, `mtr`) instantly.

-   **Your Deck is Portable.** The true power of profiles is their portability. By keeping your `~/.config/drako` directory in a Git repository, you can deploy your entire command center to a new server with a single command. This transforms `drako` into a declarative, repeatable control panel for any machine you manage.

-   **Harness, Don't Replace.** `drako` integrates with the tools you already use. If it runs in the terminal, it can be bound to the grid.

-   **The Power of TUI Decks:** For those who wish to build true terminal cathedrals, `drako` serves as the gateway to `para13`, a `TUI-Deck` build with seamless integration into `drako`. More will be revealed in time. Stay tuned


## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety First

- Only run commands you understand. Some entries perform system changes (e.g., package updates, Docker operations).
- Review commands: press `e` to open the command description and read every command.
- When unsure, consult documentation or ask a trusted friend/colleague.

## ü§ù Contribution

Ideas are welcome. Bugs will be hunted.
-   **Issues:** Report defects or propose architectural changes.
-   **Pull Requests:** Fork the repository and submit your work.
-   **Alpha State:** `drako` is currently in ALPHA. It is stable but evolving. This is your opportunity to influence its development.
