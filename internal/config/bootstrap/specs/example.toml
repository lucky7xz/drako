# Drako Profile Specification
# Usage: drako spec example

# A "Spec" defines exactly which profiles should be visible (equipped).
# When you apply a spec:
# 1. Profiles listed here are moved from 'inventory/' to the main config folder (Visible).
# 2. Profiles NOT listed here (except Core) are moved to 'inventory/' (Hidden).
# 3. The order of profiles is updated to match this list.

profiles = [
    "git",       # Enable 'git' profile
    #"unix_101",  # Enable 'unix_101' profile
    "docker_101" # Commented out: 'docker_101' will be moved to inventory
]
