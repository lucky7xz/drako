# Drako Profile Specification
# Usage: drako spec example

# A "Spec" defines exactly which profiles should be visible (equipped).
# When you apply a spec:
# 1. Profiles listed here are moved from 'inventory/' to the main config folder (Visible). 
# 2. Profiles NOT listed here are moved to 'inventory/' (Hidden).

profiles = [
    
	"ssh-utils",
