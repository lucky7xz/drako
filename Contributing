# Contributing to Drako

Thanks for considering a contribution! This document explains how to contribute and the licensing terms that apply.

## Quick start
- Fork, branch, commit small logical changes.
- Follow existing code style.
- Include a clear PR description.
- Sign off your commits (DCO) — see “Developer Certificate of Origin” below.

## Licensing model
- Core application code (everything outside `bootstrap/`) is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later.
- Bootstrap assets (`bootstrap/`) are licensed under MIT or Apache-2.0 (as indicated per file).

Use SPDX headers:
- Core files: `SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-or-later`
- Bootstrap files: `SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT` or `Apache-2.0`

## Inbound = Outbound
By contributing, you agree your contribution is licensed under the same license(s) as the part of the project you modify:
- Core contributions → AGPL-3.0-or-later
- Bootstrap contributions → MIT or Apache-2.0 (matching the file/subtree)

This ensures the project can redistribute your changes under its existing licenses.

## Relicensing permission (maintainer rights)
In addition to the above, you grant the Drako maintainers a perpetual, worldwide, royalty‑free, irrevocable license to relicense your contribution, in whole or in part of Drako, under:
- Any later version of the AGPL or GPL/LGPL families, and
- Any OSI‑approved license, if the maintainers decide to adjust the project’s overall licensing in the future.

This clause exists to avoid relicensing roadblocks and keep the project healthy long‑term. You will remain credited for your contribution.

If you cannot grant this permission (e.g., employer IP restrictions), please open an issue before submitting code.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
We use the DCO to confirm you have the right to contribute under the stated licenses.
