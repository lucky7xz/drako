Recommended approach: Steam Input mapping



Controller → Drako key mapping

D‑Pad/Left Stick → Arrow keys for navigation.

A → Enter (select).
B → Esc or q (back/quit context).

X → e (Explain).
Y → i (Inventory).

LB → Tab (toggle Grid/Path).
RB → Backtick "``" (Next profile).

Start/Options → r (Start‑Lock toggle).
Back paddles → Number shortcuts:


Optional:
Right trackpad scroll → Up/Down arrows.
Left trackpad click → Enter.
Why this is solid
Cross‑platform via Steam Input.
Predictable, easy to audit (only emits keystrokes your TUI already handles).

=========
Setup steps (Deck UI / Desktop Mode)

Per‑app (preferred):
Steam → Games → Add a Non‑Steam Game → point to your drako launcher (or a wrapper script).
Select the new entry → Controller Layout → Edit → bind controls as above. Save as a personal layout.
Launch Drako via this entry for consistent bindings.

Tips

Map to your profile switching: e.g. Alt+1 … Alt+9 or plain 1 … 9 depending on your numb_modifier setting.
Steam Input can send key chords (e.g., Alt+1) for profile switching with your configured numb_modifier.

If Steam is also remapping desktop inputs, prefer the per‑app layout to avoid conflicts.


Global (Desktop layout):
Steam → Settings → Controller → Desktop Layout → Edit Layout.
Bind controls to the keys above. Save layout.
This applies anywhere on the desktop, including terminals.
